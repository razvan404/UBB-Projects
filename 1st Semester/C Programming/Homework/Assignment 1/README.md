Solve at least 2 of the following exercises:

1. Write a program to read a number of units of length (a float) and print out the area of a circle with that radius. Assume that the value of pi is 3.14159. After that, change the type to double and compare the results.

2. Read two integers and compute their sum, average and sum of the squares of the numbers.

3. Write a program that computes out the largest and smallest values of 5 numbers read from the input.

4. Given as input a floating number of centimeters, print the corresponding number of feet (integer) and inches (floating, 1 decimal), with the inches given to an accuracy of one decimal place.
Assume 2.54 centimeters per inch, and 12 inches per foot. 

5. Knowing that we have coins of 1, 2 and 5 units, determine the minimum number of coins to pay a given amount.

6. Given the natural number h and m, that represent the current time expressed in hours and minutes, compute the time after x hours and y minutes.
 
7. Being given the values of the diagonals of a diamond shape (romb), compute the area and perimeter of the diamond shape.
