Solve at least one of the following problems in 2 ways:
- first without pointers
- second with pointers (pointer arithmetics instead of array[i]), but using your own user defined functions:

1. Write a program that reads 2 arrays and merges the two arrays into third array.
Before merging, sorte the 2 arrays in ascending order.

2. Write a program that reads a 2D array and prints transpose of the array.

3. Write a program that reverses a string (array of char) entered by the user.
