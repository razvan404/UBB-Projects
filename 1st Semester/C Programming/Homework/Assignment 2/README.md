Solve 2 ways: 
- first, without using any user defined functions (just using main, but using arrays)  
- second, using your own defined functions (at least one more function besides main)
at least one of the following problems:

1. Write a program to read a set of integers and print the maximum and minimun value.

2. Use Eratosthenes's sieve to determine all prime numbers less than a given integer.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

3. Write a program to read an integer with max 3 digits and print the value in words (111 will be printed as one hundred and eleven)

4. Write a program that, given an integer n, computes the first n values from Fibonacci Series.
